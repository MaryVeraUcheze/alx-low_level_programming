##VARIADIC FUNCTION
A variadic function is a function that accepts a variable number of arguments. In other words, a function that can take a different number of arguments every time it is called.

In many programming languages, variadic functions are typically declared with a special syntax that indicates the variable arguments, such as using "..." or "*args" in Python or "..." in C/C++.

Variadic functions are useful when you need to write a function that can accept a varying number of arguments, without having to create different versions of the same function for different argument counts. Common examples of variadic functions include printf() in C/C++, which can take a variable number of arguments to print to the console, or the join() method in Python, which can concatenate a variable number of strings.

To use a variadic function, you simply pass the arguments you want to the function when calling it, and the function will take care of handling the variable argument list. However, it's important to ensure that the function is designed to handle the varying number of arguments properly, such as checking for null or invalid inputs, or using a loop to process each argument in turn.
